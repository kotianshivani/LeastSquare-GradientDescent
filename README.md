This code is used to predict the future "Close" values of the stock market.
the data.csv file contains NIFTY Next 50 index values from 01-01-2019 to 25-02-2019

Instead of taking the dates in the dd/mm/yyyy format, i have taken a sequence of natural numbers.
eg- 1 corresponds to 1st Jan.. 44 corresponds to 1st Feb corresponds to 24
Hence to predict the future value, multiply the natural number that corresponds the date you want to predict the value for.
